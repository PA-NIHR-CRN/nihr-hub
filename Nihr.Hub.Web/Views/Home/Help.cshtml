    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The <strong>NIHR Hub</strong> is your centrally-provided suite of secure, cloud-based applications, designed to
      make working
      together across the NIHR easier and more effective. The <strong>NIHR IS Function</strong> is responsible for
      provisioning access to
      these tools, and providing limited support where appropriate.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Our strength comes from collaboration, but we know that working between different host organisations, each with
      its own internal IT systems, can be challenging. The NIHR Hub acts as a bridge, providing a common set of digital
      tools that everyone across the NIHR can use.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Whether you need to co-author a document with a colleague in another centre, host a video
      conference with a
      national team, or collaborate on a virtual whiteboard, the Hub provides the approved tools to do so securely and
      efficiently.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Think of it as an extension of your own organisation's IT, built specifically for cross-NIHR collaboration.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Explore the applications and services available below to see how the Hub can support your work.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="google-workspace">Google Workspace</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What is it?</strong> The foundation of the NIHR Hub, providing integrated tools for
      your daily work. Your @@nihr.ac.uk account gives you access to Gmail, Calendar, Drive (for cloud storage), the
      Google Docs suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides), Google Meet (for video), Google Chat (for instant messaging), Sites (for
      simple website building), Forms (for surveys), Keep (for notes), Groups (for mailing lists), and more. Google
      Gemini is also integrated with Google Workspace to help you review and create content.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Who's it for?</strong> All NIHR Hub users. This is the essential toolkit for
      cross-NIHR communication and collaboration.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="google-gemini">Google Gemini</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What is it?</strong> Google's conversational AI tool. You can ask it questions in
      natural language to help you draft emails, analyse text, generate ideas, write code, or learn about new topics. It
      is integrated within the NIHR Hub to provide a secure environment for exploring the use of AI.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Who's it for?</strong> All NIHR Hub users who want to explore how AI can enhance their

      <li><strong>Do not use Gemini for non-NIHR related work:</strong> Do not input any non-NIHR related information
        into Gemini.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="appsheet">AppSheet</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What is it?</strong> AppSheet allows you to create mobile and web applications without
      writing any code. For example, you could build a simple app for event registration, project tracking, or inventory
      management.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Who's it for?</strong> Technical colleagues and teams who need a custom solution for a
      specific internal business process but don't have access to software development resources.</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to be aware of</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Licensing:</strong> The NIHR has AppSheet Core licensing as part of its Google Workspace
        subscription. Please review the features available under the AppSheet Core licence before considering AppSheet
        for your development.
      </li>
      <li><strong>External users:</strong> AppSheet applications can only be shared with internal NIHR users (users with
        an nihr.ac.uk account).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data Sensitivity:</strong> Do not use AppSheet to create applications that collect or manage personal,
        confidential, or sensitive data without formal Information Governance review and approval.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Support:</strong> Centrally-provided support for apps you build is limited. You are primarily
        responsible for maintaining and supporting the applications you create.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="docusign">DocuSign</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What is it?</strong> A secure platform that replaces paper-and-ink signatures with a
      faster, fully audited electronic process. It is used for contracts, formal agreements, and official approvals.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Who's it for?</strong> Primarily for colleagues in operations, finance, HR, and
      research management. A licence is required to send documents, though anyone can receive and sign them.</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to be aware of</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Licensing:</strong> Sending documents requires a specific licence. To request one, please contact the
        Service Desk.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Legally Binding:</strong> Signatures captured via DocuSign are legally compliant and carry a full
        audit trail.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Programmatic use:</strong> The NIHR has a finite number of ‘envelopes’ that can be sent using Docusign
        each year. An envelope is a document that needs signing. For this reason, programmatic use of Docusign is
        allowed on a case by case basis. Do not assume you can integrate the NIHR Docusign with your application without
        first consulting the NIHR Service Desk.

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to be aware of</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Licensing:</strong> Anyone with an nihr.ac.uk account can log in to Lucid and claim a licence. Licences are recycled after 12 months of inactivity within the Lucid application.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data Sensitivity:</strong> Be mindful of the information you place in diagrams, especially if they are
        widely shared.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="kanbanchi">Kanbanchi</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What is it?</strong> A task board that helps you visualise your workflow, typically
      using columns like 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'. It's fully integrated with Google Workspace, allowing you
      to attach files from Drive and manage deadlines.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Who's it for?</strong> Teams looking for a straightforward, visual way to manage
      shared tasks and small-to-medium-sized projects without the complexity of a tool like Jira.</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to be aware of</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Simplicity is Key:</strong> Kanbanchi is best for simple workflow and task management. For complex
        projects with detailed reporting needs, Jira may be more appropriate. Kanbanchi is very similar to the ‘Work
        Management’ project type in Jira.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Licences:</strong> Everyone in the NIHR can access Kanbanchi, as we have a domain-wide licence.</li>

      <li><strong>Jira:</strong> A tool for planning, tracking, and managing complex projects, especially favoured by
        software development and technical teams. It's built for agile methodologies, bug tracking, and detailed
        reporting.

    <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Who's it for?</strong> Formal project teams, technical teams, and programme management
      offices that require structured, auditable project tracking and documentation.</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Things to be aware of</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><strong>Licensing:</strong> Anyone with an nihr.ac.uk account can access Jira and Confluence. However, we do have a
        finite number of licences that are rotated regularly when users are inactive for a period of 6 months. You can contact the service desk if you need your licence restored.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Jira project type:</strong> Users of Jira are only allowed to create ‘team-managed’ projects. This
        gives project teams full autonomy in configuring their Jira projects, rather than relying on the IS Function team
        for administration.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Support:</strong> Centrally-provided support for projects you create is limited. You are primarily
        responsible for maintaining and supporting the projects/spaces you create. Learning is available through the
        Live Learning portal.
