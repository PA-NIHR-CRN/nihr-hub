      Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile

      We use cookies to ensure the NIHR Hub ("the Hub") functions
      correctly, to remember your preferences, and to help us understand
      how visitors use our site.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use cookies</h2>

        These are essential for you to move around the Hub and use its
        features, such as accessing secure areas (logging in) or managing
        your cookie preferences. These cookies cannot be turned off.

        which pages you visit most often. This data helps us improve how
        the Hub works. These are only set if you give us your consent.
